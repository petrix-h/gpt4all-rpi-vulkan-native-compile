# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
	* an experiment if gpt4all could give more preformance then ollama on a raspberry pi 4 through the Vulkan shaders (yes it's stupid but so is putting a jet engine on a motorcycle :D ) 
* Version
	* the configs will live if/when new tricks are found
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up? ###

* Use the .sh script as a baseline for running commands on a clean rasbian distro... 
* been testing on a Pi 4 with 4 GB ram, only one I have, so that's what things might work on..
